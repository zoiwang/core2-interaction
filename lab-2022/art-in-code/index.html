                <h2>Louise Bourgeois</h2>
                <p>Born in Paris in <span>1911</span>, Louise Bourgeois was raised by parents who ran a tapestry restoration business. As a gifted student, she also helped out in the workshop by drawing missing elements in the scenes depicted on the tapestries.
                    During this time, her father carried on an affair with Sadie Gordon Richmond, the English tutor who lived in the family house. This deeply troubling—and ultimately defining—betrayal remained a vivid memory for Bourgeois for the rest
                    of her life. Later, she would study mathematics before eventually turning to art. She met Robert Goldwater, an American art historian, in Paris and they married and moved to New York in <span>1938</span>. The couple raised three sons.</p>
                <p>Early on, Bourgeois focused on painting and printmaking, turning to sculpture only in the later <span>1940s</span>. However, by the <span>1950s</span> and early <span>1960s</span>, there are gaps in her production as she became immersed
                    in psychoanalysis. Then, in <span>1964</span>, for an exhibition after a long hiatus, Bourgeois presented strange, organically shaped plaster sculptures that contrasted dramatically with the totemic wood pieces she had exhibited earlier.
                    But alternating between forms, materials, and scale, and veering between figuration and abstraction became a basic part of Bourgeois’s vision, even while she continually probed the same themes: loneliness, jealousy, anger, and fear.</p>
                <p>Bourgeois’s idiosyncratic approach found few champions in the years when formal issues dominated art world thinking. But by the <span>1970s</span> and <span>1980s</span>, the focus had shifted to the examination of various kinds of imagery
                    and content. In <span>1982</span>, at 70 years old, Bourgeois finally took center stage with a retrospective at The Museum of Modern Art. After that, she was filled with new confidence and forged ahead, creating monumental spiders,
                    eerie room-sized “Cells,” evocative figures often hanging from wires, and a range of fabric works fashioned from her old clothes. All the while she constantly made drawings on paper, and also returned to printmaking. Art was her tool
                    for coping; it was an exorcism. Bourgeois died in New York in <span>2010</span>, at the age of 98.</p>

                <p>Spider is a giant sculpture of an arachnid that stands on the floor. The artwork is made of bronze and granite and was created in 1994 by the French-born American artist Louise Bourgeois. One of the first of many sculptures of spiders
                    made by the artist, Spider measures 2743 x 4572 x 3785 mm, such that it is large enough to occupy the entire space of a room. The body of the spider supports a rounded cage-like structure inside which is held a large white egg. The
                    cage hangs below a cylindrical form, to which are attached eight thin legs stretching out to the floor. Each of the legs is articulated in three sections made of straight rods of bronze, with the exception of one of the legs, where
                    the two sections are bent, creating a semi-circle. The lower parts of seven of the legs end in needle points where the sculpture meets the floor, while the eighth terminates in a small coil. The angularity of the thin legs and their
                    different heights give the impression that the spider is crawling.</p>
