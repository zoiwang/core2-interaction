                    <p class="comment-style">Ultimately, the standout actor is the venerable James Whitmore, doing his finest work in years. Whitmore's Brooks is a brilliantly realized character, and the scenes with him attempting to cope with life outside of Shawshank represents
                        one of the film's most moving - and effective - sequences. </p>

                    <p>The character of Brooks demonstrated that they sentence you to life and that's exactly what they take. He was completely institutionalized. Brooks pondered committing another crime in order to return to prison. He took his own life
                        instead.

                    <p>After finding it very difficult out in the world, Brook longs to break his parole so they'd send him back. We as an audience are forced to wonder is this not a glimpse into the underlying causes of recidivism, for the fact that so
                        many prisoners return to prison within a short span after release. </p>

                    <p>When Andy is convicted of his wife's murder, the judge pronounces him "a particularly remorseless and icy man." He sustains that chill when he first arrives at Shawshank, remaining aloof from other inmates even when those inmates threaten
                        him with physical harm. </p>

                    <p> “The Shawshank Redemption” is cinematic medicine, capable of pulling us out of despair and leading us onto a brighter, more worthwhile path. Frank Darabont, the writer and director, displays the powerful essence of Stephen King’s original
                        novel. He understands that the human condition is the motor that runs every King story. </p>
