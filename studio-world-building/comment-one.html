                        barbed wire and iron bars. </p>

                    <p>Andy Dufresne is a young, smart, and ambitious banker in Portland, Maine who is accused and later convicted of murdering his wife and her extramarital lover. At first, he appears to the audience as a cold, detached, and remorseless
                        person who very well could have committed that awful crime.</p>

                    <p>Andy Dufresne, a banker who is sentenced to two life sentences at Shawshank State Prison for apparently murdering his wife and her lover. The gritty world of Shawshank Prison is populated with sadistic guards, a corrupt warden, and
                        predatory fellow inmates. </p>

                    <p>When Andy is convicted of his wife's murder, the judge pronounces him "a particularly remorseless and icy man." He sustains that chill when he first arrives at Shawshank, remaining aloof from other inmates even when those inmates threaten
                        him with physical harm. </p>

                    <p> “The Shawshank Redemption” is cinematic medicine, capable of pulling us out of despair and leading us onto a brighter, more worthwhile path. Frank Darabont, the writer and director, displays the powerful essence of Stephen King’s original
                        novel. He understands that the human condition is the motor that runs every King story. </p>
