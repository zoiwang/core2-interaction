                    <p class="comment-style">"Salvation lies within," advises Warden Norton at one point. It is the presentation of this theme that makes The Shawshank Redemption unique. While this film includes those elements, it makes them peripheral. The Shawshank Redemption
                        is all about hope and it's uplifting and cathartic. </p>

                    <p>The Shawshank Redemption was never a summer blockbuster or a critically acclaimed behemoth of a film but it is widely regarded now as one of the best American films of all-time. </p>

                    <p> Above all else, The Shawshank Redemption is a story about one man’s ability to remain hopeful during the most difficult and harsh circumstances. As Red states at the end of the film, “Get busy livin’ or get busy dyin.’ That’s goddamn
                        right.” </p>
